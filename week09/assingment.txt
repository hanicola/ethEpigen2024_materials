I have two ideas for a project

1. Critical Reproduction of the Analysis of in a Published Article
Manzo et al. (Manzo, Massimiliano, et al. "Isoform‚Äêspecific localization of DNMT3A regulates DNA methylation fidelity at bivalent CpG islands." The EMBO journal 36.23 (2017): 3421-3434.) looked at how the different isoforms of DNMT3 differ in their binding behaviour and how the coincide with other DNA marks. I would like to look at the genes these site correspond to and if there is a pattern such as an enrichment of genes belonging to certain pathways or known to be involved in diseases.

2. How does DNA-methylation affect Transcription Factor binding.
There is quite extensive literature and data on the motifs TFs recognise and also some studies looking into how the binding changes in the absence of DNA-methylation, e.g. in DNMT triple knock out cells (TKO). I would like to see if it is possible to get the sequencing data for several of these studies and perform differential motif analysis across them.
